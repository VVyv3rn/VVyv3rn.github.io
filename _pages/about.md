# Previous Work Experience
## Valleybrook Country Club as a lifeguard
June 2023 - August 2024
My primary responsibilities were to watch over the people
swimming and make sure people were safe and following the
rules. My other responsibilities were to help the other lifeguards
close at night or open in the mornings.
## Annapolis Canoe and Kayak
June 2024 – August 2024
I helped with summer rentals which required me to talk with
customers and make sure they understood what is in the contract
for them going out on the water. After doing this I would assist
them in getting ready to go out on the water and help them go out.
